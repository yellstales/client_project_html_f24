                <h3>CEW+ Annual Advocacy Symposium</h3>
                <img src="images/advocacy_symposium.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
                SAVE THE DATE for the 2024 CEW+ Advocacy Symposium on Thursday, September 26 at the Michigan League!

                <p>CEW+ annually brings together staff, faculty, students, and community members to create change
                    through introspection, dialogue, and action at our advocacy symposium. The goal is to give
                    participants practical tools to better advocate for themselves and others. CEW+ seeks to encourage
                    attendees to think about the many ways in which we can be activists as well as how we can support
                    others in navigating the current systems that impact their life. Attendees are exposed to various
                    approaches to advocacy and engage in self-reflection, group discussion, and action-planning to
                    advance their ability to advocate for themselves, others, and on behalf of causes central to their
                    professional and personal goals. U-M staff have comprised the majority of participants averaging
                    slightly under 60% over the past two years. Faculty, community members, and students comprise the
                    remainder of the audience. <br><br>

                    The advocacy symposium features a keynote lecture from a nationally or internationally renowned
                    advocate, a capstone presentation by the outgoing Twink Frey Visiting Social Activist, and the
                    introduction of the next activist. Attendees participate in workshops and roundtable discussions
                    that highlight relevant U-M resources, offer professional development skill-building, and showcase
                    the advocacy journeys of diverse speakers. The event intends to spark further engagement with the
                    work of the Center and provide opportunities for early-career and more experienced advocates to
                    share and learn from each other’s unique experiences.</p>
                <h4>Twink Frey Visiting Social Activist Program</h4>
                <p>The Twink Frey Visiting Social Activist (TFVSA) Program brings to CEW+ a social justice activist
                    whose work affects women and recognizes gender equity issues. One goal of the program is to build
                    the capacity and effectiveness of social activists. This is accomplished by giving the TFVSA time,
                    space, and support to work on a project that would not be possible under the activist’s usual
                    working circumstances. The program is made possible through a generous gift from U-M alumna and
                    Emerita Leadership Council Member Twink Frey.</p>
                <h4>Christobel Kotelawela Weerasinghe Lecture </h4>
                <p>The Weerasinghe Lecture is named for Christobel Kotelawela Weerasinghe, who worked to promote
                    international understanding and communication throughout her life. Weerasinghe was a representative
                    from 1956-to 1965 at the United Nations for the World Federation of the United Nations Association
                    in New York. She traveled and spoke widely on behalf of the UN Association. She published several
                    books for children, was an active member of Women Geographers in Washington and served on several
                    not-for-profit boards in Sri Lanka, where she resided until her passing in 2018. The lectureship
                    brings international advocates to CEW+, in collaboration with other units, for cross-cultural
                    dialogue about the advancement of women. The lectureship is made possible through a generous gift
                    from U-M alumna and Emerita Leadership Council Member Menakka Bailey in honor of her mother,
                    Christobel Kotelawela Weerasinghe.</p>

                <h3>Supporting the Academic Excellence of Student Caregivers</h3>
                <img src="images/student_caregivers.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height:auto;">


                <p>Student caregivers are some of the most focused and resourceful students on campus, as demonstrated
                    by their ability to balance school, work, and parental responsibilities. Did you know that 26% of
                    all college students nationwide are raising children?<br><br>

                    CEW+ has always served as an advocate for student caregivers. Our founder, Jean Campbell, gave life
                    to the Center’s mission to level the playing field for access to education, the pursuit of finding
                    fulfilling employment, and the acknowledgment of our complex lives. Early on the Center began
                    tackling barriers to student parent enrollment and that work actively continues today. The reality
                    is the identity of a student caregiver at U-M has never been simple or easy. Historically the Center
                    has stood the test of time because of our collaborative approach and a willingness to do the heavy
                    lifting of initiating changes that caused ripple effects at U-M and beyond. Today we are focused on
                    building our collaborative work with student parents to create more systems-level change, removing
                    barriers for student parents on their path to graduation.</p>
                <h4>Progress Higlights</h4>
                <p>
                    CEW+ is partnered with our sponsored student organization <a href="https://www.mcasp.org">MCaSP</a>,
                    which is the home to the
                    cross-campus Student Caregiver Excellence Committee and facilitates the caregivers and student
                    parents ally group. We are thankful for the members of the Michigan community who are working with
                    us and looking forward to all we can accomplish. If you would like to learn more about the resources
                    available to student caregivers, click here. Please feel free to share this link with other faculty,
