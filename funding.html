            <h2>Scholarships for U-M Students</h2>
            <img src="images/funding_pic1.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>The CEW+ Scholarship Program was established in 1970 to honor the academic performance and potential of
                women whose education has been interrupted and to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the
                admission
                of women to the University of Michigan. Thanks to the generosity of individuals, organizations, clubs,
                and
                foundations, CEW+ has awarded over 1,900 scholarships since 1970. With support from our generous donors,
                CEW+ was able to expand the program in 2008 to include additional scholarships for students of all
                genders.

                CEW+ Scholarships are invaluable and unique in that they are tailored to complement a student’s existing
                aid
                package. CEW+ centers the needs of women and underserved students in designing its programs and
                scholarship
                offerings, which are open to all regardless of protected identity characteristics.

                    <li>Students who are ineligible to complete a FAFSA can indicate this in the application and
                        will be
                        notified of an alternate process to gather comparable information.</li>

                        received a
                        CEW+ Scholarship in a previous year, you may be eligible to apply for a fellowship (note:
                        fellowships have their own specific eligibility requirements, listed here).</li>

            <img src="images/funding_page_pic2_shapiropartyformind.JPG" alt="" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>CEW+ is able to offer small emergency grants to current U-M Ann Arbor graduate students and undergraduate
                students. These grants, called Emergency Funds (EF), are for unexpected, unanticipated financial
                emergencies that threaten to derail degree progression.

                CEW+ is pleased to announce a new partnership with Central Student Government combining emergency
                funding to offer critical support for childcare expenses for international students at the University of
                Michigan, Ann Arbor campus. These funds can be accessed through CEW+ using the process detailed below.
