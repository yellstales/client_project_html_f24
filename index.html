            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women’s center.
                Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then
                known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of
                service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues
                its work today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders,
                facing education, employment, or other life issues.</p>

                <p>The Center for Continuing Education of Women opened its doors in a two-room space in the Michigan
                    League. The Center’s original mission: direct service to women who wished to return to an
                    uncompleted education; advocacy in working with the administration and faculty, and research
                    evaluating the Center’s services and outcomes.</p>

                <p>Entitled "Opportunities for Women through Education," the conference and its model were a huge
                    success. The event was attended by 240 women and more than 350 had to be turned away.</p>

            <h2>DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION</h2>
            <p>Since 1964, CEW+ has worked to remove obstacles that impact women and other marginalized groups at U-M.
                CEW+ has also served as a bridge for returning students and community college transfers and fought for
                family-friendly policies that have benefited both men and women. Our understanding of the challenges
                faced by underserved students and underrepresented faculty and staff allows us to contribute greatly to
                diversity at U-M by providing supports and resources that are responsive to the emerging needs of these
                groups.</p>

                <h3>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan</h3>
                <p> The Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has spotlighted and supported the Financial
                    Empowerment Initiative as a highlight of CEW+’s DEI 2.0 plan. An overview of the initiative was
                    presented as part of the University-wide DEI 2.0 Information Session on Oct. 18, 2023. </p>

                <h3>Selected text from President’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Charge:</h3>

                <p>From being one of the first universities to admit women in 1870 to our historic defense of race
                    conscious admission policies at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003, the University of Michigan has
                    had a fierce and longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. This commitment
                    rests upon our recognition of the history in the United States of racial, ethnic, and gender
                    discrimination as well as our understanding that our progress as an institution of higher
                    learning will be enhanced with a vibrant community of people from many backgrounds.
