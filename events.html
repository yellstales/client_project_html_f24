                    Mindful meditation is a contemplative practice that, over time, can build resilience and coping
                    skills
                    to support you to gain perspective, navigate the demands of daily life, and build compassion. Weekly
                    guided sits offer a virtual community of practice that explores present-moment awareness, open and
                    directed attention, non-judgment, and self-compassion. CEW+ Inspire Midweek Mindfulness welcomes
                    practitioners of all skill levels. Each session offers instruction, support, and the opportunity to
                    practice guided and self-directed mindful meditation. Participate weekly, or drop in as your
                    schedule
                    allows. All are welcome!</p>
