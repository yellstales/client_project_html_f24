        <h2>Our History</h2>

        <div>Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women’s center.
            Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then known
            as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of service,
            advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues its work today,
            serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders, facing education,
            employment, or other life issues.</div>
